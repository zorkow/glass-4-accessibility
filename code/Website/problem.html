						<h1>Use Case 1:</h1>
						<p class="text"> Consider an inclusive class composed of fully sighted and VI students. Despite the best efforts of any good teacher to clearly articulate whatever is written on the whiteboard, a VI student is still at a severe disadvantage since unlike a fully sighted student, they cannot visually refer back to previous steps in any proof or calculation or even their own written notes or a recording of the teacher, as the spatial layout of a formula is often lost but might be significant. Instead, they must devote significant mental effort to remembering any previous lines of formulae.
						</p>

					<div class="right">
						<h1>Use Case 2:</h1>
						<p class="text">Consider a group of students working through an exercise, a complex calculation or a proof collaboratively on a whiteboard. The challenges faced by a VI student are even greater if they want to contribute: as before, the VI student must be able to recognise and understand mathematical formulae written by other users. However, in addition, they must be able to track the location of both the current line of any proof plus all previous mathematics and what available space is left on the board.
