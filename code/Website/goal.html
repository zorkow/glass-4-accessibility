				<div class="nhome">
					<p class="text">The main result of our project will be a solution to an accessibility problem in maths education and research that will be universally applicable due to the portability of glass. In addition, our research will lead to scientific results in the areas of handwriting recognition and natural language analysis, for instance, contributing novel techniques for handwriting analysis from video feeds and speech segmentation based on image analysis.</p>
					<h1>Solution for Use Case 1</h1>
					<p class="text">A teacher wears glass to automate the recognition of what they are writing on the whiteboard which is then immediately available to VI students in the classroom via technologies such as text to speech synthesis or Braille readers.</p>
					<h1>Solution for Use Case 2</h1>
					<p class="text">If glass is able to perform accurate recognition of handwritten maths and in addition can record its location, then it will be able to provide audio cues to the visually impaired user - for instance in helping locate the last line of a proof or in reading out a new contribution by another user. We will investigate the means to support a VI learner in interacting with a white board, in order for them to be able to find space for writing on the board, avoid overwriting already existing material, and enabling them to go back to and potentially modify previously written material.</p>
